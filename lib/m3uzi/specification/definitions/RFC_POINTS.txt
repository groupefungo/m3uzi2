1) Notes & Language regarding playlist type compatability.

It would be preferable to affirm which playlist type a tag applied to rather
than use negation. 

"It MUST ONLY appear in a Media Playlist" rather than "It MUST NOT appear in a Master Playlist."

Consistency:
Language is mixed and ambiguous in several instances:

"In protocol version 6, it MAY appear in a Media Playlist." vs "In protocol version 6, it may appear in any Media Playlist."


However it would be preferable if these verbose qualifiers were replaced by
a specification: e.g.

Playlist Compatability : <Media, Master, or Both>

2) Required vs Optional



3) Examples
Are not 8.6, 8.7, and 8.8 invalid since they do not contain an EXT-X-VERSION tag
specifying version 4?
